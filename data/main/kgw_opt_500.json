We've all heard much talk on media giant Star Broadband and how they wanted to turn the telco business into profitable one within the six to 12 month time span, but Prasardhan Bharti's dismal performance is a real let-down to all. We have to note though that Prasardhat Bharti subscribers have declined by 0.19% (14 lakh customers), and voice and wireless revenue (13 lakh customers), albeit not materially impacting the profit, however affected the consolidated earnings of Rs 12,000 crore (\u20b91300-$1400 million) mark for the quarter.

The revenue generated is not good as it is and given this trend we can expect the profitability even to remain negative in the course to FY21. For a listed company which keeps churning its subscribers, we don't see Prasardha's core operations able to turn the profit anytime soon either as ARPU continues to drop. We suggest selling your PVR and HDFC stock in the near term and go long in BSNCL, which also have a positive ARPU of over Rs 150 (compiled end February-end FY21) while retaining an average debt to capital (DC) ratio of 3.8x!

{"token_count": [525], "text": " in many areas people are working together. For instance, the Civil Service in our country today is made as efficient as it is through what we call, \"involving others, working together and helping each other\". I know that you are familiar with such a philosophy! Marketing in the Public Sector in Ghana must go out to build its own wealth, wealth that affects others as much or even less, than the Marketing in the Private Sector. I therefore suggest, \"Policymaking for \"Involving Others,\" and Making the Public Sector a Success\". In this essay, I would analyze and use this concept in a discussion with some economists (A.Borlaug 2010; Hamann, & F.A.Vassago 2003a, & 2006a) who offer a theory for why the public goods approach to government policy can work. Although it is my belief that the private sector may have a role in market transformation, the main focus of this essay shall largely be with this concept \u2013 which for all fairness also belongs in the Public sector. My suggestion/idea shall suggest to government \u2013 let us learn from what the Private sector has contributed to building prosperity for the country. It shall also help that government also learns from what the private sector has contributed as some would argue that government is a hybrid of all three sectors since government is made as it is not a pure market construct. So it would be my hope that government would be guided by a more consultative approach towards this ideal \u2013 one that also gives rise to government policy that is geared to building a successful country. And make no mistake, this essay shall also suggest how to get there. I would like to leave you, then, this place with an appeal\u2013 \"Please engage yourselves with economists so you can learn from them and from what we observe in our culture.\" (Hamann & F.Vassagoe 2003a, 2006a) In this essay that is structured as it is based in the Public Service sector of Government and my observation and conversation with economists (A..borlaug 2010).

Its findings, made public on Wednesday after years of debate and debate, are being overshadowed by ongoing problems such as tainted meat and chicken in the U.K. The WHO report does note some beneficial effects on health such as reduced blood cholesterol. The results, which found that the foods of animal origins, particularly pork, were linked, were based upon lab evidence gathered between 1986-2002 regarding the association processed meats with lung cancers and cancers in the prostate. The report did identify the cancers from beef and pork but did acknowledge a reduced disease risk associated with consuming all meats. They state, \"Although the association found between diet patterns and cancer is weak or unsupportible for the present sample, a small group with particular conditions should continue to be advised againstAlgeria, officially the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, is a country in the Maghreb region of North Africa consumption since the findings for noncommunicable diseases, and smoking, are conflicting and unclear.\" The meat section of a 2013 USDA survey of nearly 68,000 shoppers revealed Americans have a healthy relationship between three daily serves of white, medium and red meats. However, when asked if the same food choice had a positive or negative health impact the numbers weren't favorable. About 11 of every 10 food or beverage choices had a negative health impact. However, this number increased to 12 of every 10 choices had a positive impact. It's important that these foods be recognized as important foods for maintaining a healthy life, they noted. Meanwhile it was more of a mixed picture when it comes to processed and red meats, as nearly 60 per cent of shoppers thought they are as unhealthy as other meats. It's not surprising considering how much meat today is processed. While 35 per cent of U.K diet consists of processed and red, or saturated fat, another 36 said it is not their regular diet, suggesting people are paying more of an eye on their meal plan. It's clear consumers don\u2019t have much control since processed vegetables can bring their diet well within the acceptable range. The study found that red, or animal fat, was a risk factor contributing eight percent of lung and 15 to 24% of prostate in men while white, or vegetable fat, was more prominent as one of several factors playing together. When comparing between-men, the risks associated with red, or lean animal fat, were 22 to 32% greater and 41 to 53 per cent for those opting for processed animal fat or vegetable fat. \"The increased risks associated with eating animal fat rather than vegetable fat may simply reflect the increased risks associated solely with animal fat, or", "flag": 1, "segments": [[154, 179]], "strength": 5.5}
